# Hand of Evil
Xcursor theme based on **Dungeon Keeper II** in-game cursors.

You can see how **default**, **pointing hand** (it appears when you hover the mouse over a hyperlink, for example) and **wait** (hourglass) cursors look like. 

*Please note, that gif images suffer some loss of the quality, especcially for semitransparent gradient transitions.*

## License

I asked Electronic Arts for the permission to create and share this theme and they answered:
>We cannot provide you with express permission; however, based on what you describe, we do not object to the use of our assets in this manner.

## Installation

You can find the package ready for the installation in Gnome, KDE and other desktop environments in [releases section](https://github.com/Grief/hand-of-evil/releases).

The package is uploaded to [opendesktop.org](http://opendesktop.org/content/show.php/Hand+of+Evil?content=175746) (opendekstop.org is reconstructing, so here is the link to [gnome-look.org](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/999427/)) as well, so you can install it from there, e.g. if you use KDE, open `System Settings`, navigate to `Cursor Theme`, click `Get New Theme...` button, search for `Hand of Evil` and install it.

## Customization

You can build the installable package by yourself, if you want.

To do that, clone the repository and simply run `hand-of-evil.sh`:

    git clone https://github.com/Grief/hand-of-evil.git
    hand-of-evil/hand-of-evil.sh

You can modify `mapping.conf` file to apply changes you desire to the theme.
